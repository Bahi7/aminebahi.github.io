I am a PhD researcher in cryptography with the **CASCADE team** at École normale supérieure (ENS, Paris) and a member of the **Encrypted Systems Lab** at Brown University, where I am fortunate to be mentored by [Tarik Moataz](https://cs.brown.edu/people/tmoataz/) and [Brice Minaud](https://www.di.ens.fr/brice.minaud/).

My research focuses on **structured encryption**, **Private Information Retrieval (PIR)**, **Oblivious RAM (ORAM)**, **volume-hiding systems**, and **Bayesian leakage analysis**. I am passionate about developing cryptographic protocols that enable secure and efficient data processing while preserving privacy.

Beyond academia, I am the **Co-founder & CTO** at [Rabiata](https://rabiata.com), where we apply cutting-edge cryptographic techniques to real-world problems. I also have a strong interest in **quantitative trading** and the intersection of cryptography with financial systems.

## Research Interests

- **Structured Encryption**: Developing secure schemes for searching on encrypted data
- **Private Information Retrieval (PIR)**: Enabling private queries to public databases
- **Oblivious RAM (ORAM)**: Hiding access patterns to encrypted storage
- **Volume-Hiding Systems**: Concealing the size and structure of encrypted data
- **Bayesian Leakage Analysis**: Quantifying information leakage in cryptographic protocols
- **Applied Cryptography**: Implementing practical privacy-preserving systems

Feel free to reach out for research collaborations, consulting opportunities, or discussions about cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies.
